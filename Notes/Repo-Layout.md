# Question:
In a production grade microservice product repository, how should the folders structured, with the source codes, dependencies, terraform templates, kubernetes files, helm charts, ansible playbooks, etc? Show me some concrete examples, if the microservice backend is developed in go or node.js.

## ChatGpt's Answer
Structuring a production-grade microservice repository requires a clear separation of concerns, modularity, and intuitive organization so that new and existing developers can understand the codebase and infrastructure components quickly.

Let's start by imagining a hypothetical microservice named "user-service". Here's a structure that can be considered:

```
user-service/
│
├── src/                  # Source code directory
│   ├── controllers/      # API controllers
│   ├── models/           # Data models
│   ├── routes/           # API route definitions
│   ├── middleware/       # Middleware utilities (e.g., authentication)
│   ├── utils/            # Utility functions and classes
│   ├── tests/            # Unit and integration tests
│   ├── main.go           # (or index.js for Node.js) Entry point for the service
│   └── ...               # Other relevant source code folders/files
│
├── deployments/          # Infrastructure and deployment related
│   ├── terraform/        # Terraform templates
│   │   ├── modules/      # Modular components for Terraform
│   │   ├── staging/      # Staging specific configs
│   │   ├── production/   # Production specific configs
│   │   └── main.tf       # Main Terraform config file
│   │
│   ├── kubernetes/       # Raw Kubernetes manifests
│   │   ├── deployment.yaml
│   │   ├── service.yaml
│   │   └── ...
│   │
│   ├── helm/             # Helm chart for the service
│   │   ├── charts/
│   │   ├── templates/
│   │   ├── values.yaml
│   │   └── Chart.yaml
│   │
│   └── ansible/          # Ansible playbooks and roles
│       ├── playbooks/
│       ├── roles/
│       └── inventory/
│
├── Dockerfile            # Dockerfile for the service
├── .dockerignore         # Files to be ignored during Docker build
├── .gitignore            # Files/folders ignored by Git
├── README.md             # Readme with information about the service, build & deployment steps
├── package.json          # (For Node.js) Node.js dependencies and scripts
├── go.mod                # (For Go) Go module dependencies
└── go.sum                # (For Go) Expected sums for modules
```

**Things to note**:

1. **Separate Source from Infrastructure**: Keeping your application source code (`src/`) separated from deployment configurations (`deployments/`) allows for clarity. It's clear where application logic resides and where the infrastructure and deployment configurations are.

2. **Environment-specific Configs**: For tools like Terraform, you might have different configurations for staging, development, and production environments. Keeping these separate is crucial.

3. **Modular Approach**: Utilizing modules in Terraform, or similar concepts in other tools, can help in reusing code across multiple services or environments.

4. **Clear Documentation**: Always have a `README.md` at the root and within complex directories to guide developers through the codebase, explain conventions, and detail deployment steps.

5. **Centralized Configuration**: If you have multiple microservices, consider centralizing common configurations, especially Terraform or Ansible scripts, in a separate repository or a shared directory to avoid duplication.

6. **Repository Per Service Vs. Monorepo**: The structure illustrated is for a single microservice. Some organizations prefer a monorepo approach where multiple services live in the same repository. The decision between these approaches depends on your team's size, the scale of services, and the tooling in place.

Remember that while this structure is a suggestion, the actual structure you choose should cater to the needs and preferences of your team and the nature of your project. Adjustments may be needed based on specific requirements, tooling, or development methodologies in place.
