# Shell Script to Force Quit All Docker-Related Processes

This is a simple shell script to force quit all processes related to Docker on a MacBook.

Here is the script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get a list of all processes related to "docker"
docker_processes=$(ps aux | grep -i "docker" | grep -v "grep" | awk '{print $2}')

# Loop through the list of processes and kill each one
for pid in $docker_processes
do
    echo "Killing process with PID: $pid"
    kill -9 $pid
done

echo "All Docker-related processes have been killed."
```

This script first uses `ps aux | grep -i "docker"` to get a list of all processes related to "docker". The `-i` flag makes the search case-insensitive.

The `grep -v "grep"` part is used to exclude the `grep "docker"` command itself from the list of processes to kill.

The `awk '{print $2}'` part is used to extract the PID (process ID) of each process, which is the second field in the output of `ps aux`.

The script then loops through each PID in the list and uses `kill -9` to force quit the process. The `-9` flag sends the `SIGKILL` signal, which cannot be caught, blocked, or ignored.

Please note that this script requires administrator privileges to run, as killing processes is a privileged operation.

Before running this script, ensure that you really want to kill all Docker-related processes, as this can cause data loss or other issues if Docker is in the middle of an operation. Always make sure to stop and remove Docker containers using proper Docker commands (`docker stop`, `docker rm`) whenever possible, and only use a script like this as a last resort.

To run the script, save it to a file (e.g., `kill_docker.sh`), make it executable with `chmod +x kill_docker.sh`, and run it with `sudo ./kill_docker.sh`.
